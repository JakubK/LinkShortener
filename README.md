# LinkShortener
LinkShortener will be an application that will help you to shorten your links. It will support both anonymous and registered users.
Registered ones will have more options such as modyfying their links.

### Authors' note
This project has two official authors: [@PiotrGardocki](https://github.com/PiotrGardocki) and [@JakubK](https://github.com/JakubK).
But, on GithHub it is possible for repository to have only one owner, so the owner on GitHub is @JakubK.
@PiotrGardocki has a fork from original repository and works on his own copy, but as a contributor has full priviliges to original one.

@JakubK is responsible for frontend (HTML, CSS, JS, React)

@PiotrGardocki is responsible for backend (Python, Django)
